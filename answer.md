#### Lesson 5 Blockquotes

##### Example 1

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

##### Example 2

> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
> His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
> He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

##### Example 3

> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

#### Lesson 6 Lists

Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

Be careful when holding the knife.

For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

#### Lesson 7 Paragraphs

##### Example 1

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

##### Example 2

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

   If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

   Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

#### **HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE**

_Hypertext Markup Language_ (**HTML**) is a markup language used to create and link webpages. It defines the basic structure of a web page and contains meta-data about the page and a series of elements to be displayed on the web page. It uses predefined tags such as _table_, _form_, etc. to render different elements on the webpage. Each element requires starting and ending tag with content inside it.

> Marked up document written in **HTML** is displayed by a web browser that interprets different tags and accordingly formats and structures the content of the document before displaying it.

It can be written in a plain text editor and can be associated with styling sheets such as **CSS** (_Cascading Style Sheets_) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

**Features:**

1. Easy to learn
2. Platform-independent
3. Support audio, video, and images embedded web pages
4. Supported by all browsers
5. Can be integrated with styling and scripting languages.

#### **EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE**

_Extensible Markup Language_ (**XML**) is a markup language used for storing structured data. It uses custom tags to define the elements which support a wide range of elements.

> It was developed because **HTML** was unable to define new elements hence **XML** was introduced which was extensible to define custom elements.

It was designed to store and transport data and contain information about the sender, receiver, heading, and message body. It is more focused on what data is rather than how data looks. It is used for representing documents, data, transactions, invoices, etc.

**Features:**

1. Efficient data sharing
2. Software and hardware independent
3. Compatible with other markup languages
4. Supports platform transition
5. Supports Unicode
